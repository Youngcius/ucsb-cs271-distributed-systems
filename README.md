# UCSB CS271 (Distributed Systems) Course Projects

> Instructor: Prof. [Amr El Abbadi](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~amr/)


This repository contains a series of course projects of UCSB CS271 (Distributed Systems) in Winter 2023, about implementations of classical distributed computing systems algorithms/protocols from scratch. I frequently used Python/Pydantic/FastAPI/Cryptography and multi-thread techniques.

- [Project 1](./project1/): Implementation of a blockchain demo based on Lamport Logic Clocks protocol
- [Project 2](./project2/): Implementation of Chandy-Lamport global snapshot algorithm to take global snapshots of a simple token-passing application
- [Final Project](./project-final/): Implementation of Raft protocol and a distributed shared dictionary system replicated on a set of clients based on Raft


See README files in each project folder for more details.
